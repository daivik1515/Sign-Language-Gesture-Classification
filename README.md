**üåê Project Overview**

This project aims to create a robust, deep learning-based system for classifying sign language gestures in real time, facilitating improved communication for individuals with hearing impairments. By implementing and comparing several CNN architectures, including LeNet, VGG, and ResNet, the project will assess which model performs best in identifying a variety of sign gestures across different datasets. The system leverages transfer learning and hyperparameter optimization to achieve high accuracy and adaptability across diverse environments.

**üìÇ Datasets**

To build a well-rounded, versatile model, we've selected three datasets that represent a wide range of gestures and sign languages:

**Sign Language Digits Dataset**

Samples: 2,062 images

Resolution: 100x100

[Sign Language Digits Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ardamavi/sign-language-digits-dataset)

**Indian Sign Language Dataset**

Samples: 42,000 images

Resolution: 128x128

[Indian Sign Language Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaishnaviasonawane/indian-sign-language-dataset)

**Hand Gesture Recognition Dataset**

Samples: 3,259 images

Resolution: 240x215

[Hand Gesture Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarjit07/hand-gesture-recog-dataset)

Model performance is then evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve, allowing a comprehensive comparison across architectures to determine the most effective approach for gesture recognition.

**üìä Evaluation Metrics**

To thoroughly evaluate model performance, we‚Äôll be assessing each CNN on:

- **Accuracy**
 
- **Precision**
  
- **Recall**
  
- **F1 Score**
  
- **ROC Curve**
